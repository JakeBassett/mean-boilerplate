# mean-boilerplate

## Warning

This is a VERY rough work in progress. The project structure, code, and 
documentation are not anywhere close to being complete or optimized. 
I am making this repo public in hopes that even in its rough state it 
may help someone get started with this flavor of tech stack. 

Once I am comfortable with the state of this project I will release a 
version 1.0 and write a blog post tour of what the boilerplate provides. 
Until then, no judgement is allowed. :-)
